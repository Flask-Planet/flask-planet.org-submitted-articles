The Pallets team have made the decision to drop support for Python 3.7 earlier than planned. 

As of the milestone version of 2.3.0 if you try and install Flask using pip under Python 3.7 you will see the error: 

`No matching distribution found for Flask==2.3.0`

Python 3.7 was scheduled to reach its end-of-life on the 27th of June 2023, as set by the Python Software Foundation. See this handy chart -> [](https://endoflife.date/python)

Of course, Flask users still on Python 3.7 can continue using older versions of Flask before 2.3.0, but at your own peril! It is recommended to consider upgrading to a more recent Python version to ensure compatibility and access ongoing support.
